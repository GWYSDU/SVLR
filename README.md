SVLR is tool designed to detect structural variation using third generation sequencing (PacBio or Oxford Nanopore). 
It detects all types of SVs (10bp+) using evidence from split-read alignments, read confidence, optimization analysis.
The current version of SVLR utilizes the alignments from NGMLR or LAST.
If you have any susgetions or problems when you apply SVLR to detect structure variants, please contact to us by: gwy@mail.sdu.edu.cn.
